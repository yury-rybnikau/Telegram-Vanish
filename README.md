**Telegram Vanish** is a Python script that allows users to delete their messages in Telegram groups and channels. Additionally, it helps you leave unwanted chats after messages are deleted.

## Features

- **Delete Messages**: Remove all your messages from selected chats or groups using a CSV file.
- **Leave Chats**: Leave groups or channels after deleting all your messages.
- **User-Friendly Menu**: Interactive command-line menu for easy usage.

## Prerequisites

## Usage
